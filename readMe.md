# Contributing!
You are allowed to contribute to coffee engine but you have to follow some basic rules
## Node JS is prohibited in the main repo
There is a good reason behind this as coffee engine is built to be as portable as possible and node would only make that mission harder.
## No purposely making Security Vulnerabilities
This one is pretty self explanatory as this would only hurt the engine and not help it!
## Commenting
Commenting is encouraged for when you contribute code to the engine! But it might be a good idea to add a signature at the end of your comment to let people know who edited what last.
