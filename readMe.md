# Contributing!
You are allowed to contribute to coffee engine but you have to follow some basic rules
## Javascript packages are not allowed in the main repo.
There is a good reason behind this as coffee engine is built to be as portable and minimal as possible.
## No purposely making Security Vulnerabilities
This one is pretty self explanatory as this would only hurt the engine and not help it!
## Commenting
Commenting is encouraged for when you contribute code to the engine! But it might be a good idea to add a signature at the end of your comment to let people know who edited what last.
## Optimization
If you see a bit of code that needs or could be optimized please optimize it and create a pull request on the main repo! Your help is really appreciated!

# Feature Requests
Feature Requests should be suggested in the discussions tab with the correct label.
